# Survivor Scoreboard

Sometimes when you draft survivor, you want to see the scores on another screen.

This repo is still up for legacy purposes, but there are vulnerabilities in its dependencies, so I advise against cloning it without fixing those. If you want to submit a pull request to fix them, so much the better!
